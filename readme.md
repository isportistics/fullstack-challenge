The objective of this challenge is to evaluate your domain in fullstack development: its organization, style and good practices with code, APIs creation, frameworks knowledge and technologies.

## Rules

1. Your code should be made available in a public or private repository, on your personal github, gitlab or bitbucket;
2. Send the link to mauricio@isportistics.com;
3. We use HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and Python. It is preferable to use these technologies, but you can contact us if you don't know any of them and want to develop with another technology.

## Challenge

### Front-end

The following layout should be developed
![layout](layout-onepage.png)

[You can download the PSD here](layout-onepage.psd)

- You can use the libs and frameworks that make you more comfortable;
- All fields are required in the form;
- We'll be happy if you develop tests for it;

### Back-end

The layout has a form, a table with percentage information of participation and a pizza graph that represents this distribution.

- You need to create APIs that sends and receives these informations;
- We'll be happy if you develop tests for it;
- In case of inconsistency, return the error in a structured JSON with HTTP 400 code;

#### Plus

Feel free to make improviments like new funcionalities, visual optimizations, API security, etc. ðŸ˜‰
